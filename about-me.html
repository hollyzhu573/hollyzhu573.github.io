                <p><b>besides the technical stuff:</b></p>
                <p><i>i love figure skating!</i> i've been skating for almost fourteen years and counting. covid-19 cut my competitive career short, but i now skate for fun here on UCSD's club team and partake in intercollegiate competitions as well!</p>
                <P><i>i'm learning calligraphy and like to make/edit videos.</i> way back in 2016, i created an instagram account to display the random bits of art and hand lettering i had been trying out. that soon turned into a creative place to post my artistics endeavors, from sticker-making to bullet journaling and graphic art.</P>
                <p>                        that was how holligraphy was formed.</p>
                <p>i ended up branching out to youtube videos as well, and used holligraphy as a creative outlet where i could experiment with different things. though it is less active now due to school, it is a passion project that is dear to my heart.</p>
